@QUARKPLAYER_DESCRIPTION@

%prep
# Extract the source and go into the root source directory
# where the special Makefile is
# This is a bit tricky: I don't want to download the source code,
# to create a .tar.bz2 and then extract it: this is useless
# Let's directly use the current source code directory
# -D : do not delete the directory before unpacking sources
# -T : do not perform default archive unpacking
# -n : set the name of build directory
%setup -D -T -n .

%build
# Build the source code
# Done by CMake
#make CMAKE_BINARY_DIR=@CMAKE_BINARY_DIR@ configure
make  -f @CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR@/Makefile CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR=@CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR@ CMAKE_BINARY_DIR=@CMAKE_BINARY_DIR@

%install
# Install all files into the BuildRoot
make  -f @CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR@/Makefile CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR=@CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR@ CMAKE_BINARY_DIR=@CMAKE_BINARY_DIR@ BUILD_DIR=@BUILD_DIR@ DESTDIR=%{buildroot} install

%clean
# Clean up the hard disc after build
rm -rf %{buildroot}

%files
# Copy all the files that come with 'make install'
%attr(-,root,root) /usr/*
