	/**
	 * All plugins have been loaded.
	 *
	 * This signal is usefull for doing some processing after the GUI has
	 * been drew (i.e all plugins loaded since most of the plugins contain GUIs).
	 *
	 * Typical case:
	 * the playlist plugin loads automatically current_playlist.m3u which can
	 * be huge. Instead of doing it inside the playlist plugin constructor,
	 * we do it inside a slot connected to this signal. This way, the GUI
	 * is drew very quickly.
	 *
	 * Consider using Qt::QueuedConnection when you connect to this signal,
	 * this way you won't block the signal from being sent to other slots.
	 *
	 * Qt::AutoConnection is in fact Qt::DirectConnection
	 * and Qt::DirectConnection waits for the current slot to process before
	 * to deliver the signal to other slots.
	 *
	 * So if your slot needs a lot of time to process, it is better to use
	 * Qt::QueuedConnection
	 *
